# Analysis of Customers' Behaviour - British Airways

This repository contains the work and findings from my virtual internship experience with British Airways, focusing on the analysis of customers' behaviour. The goal of this project was to utilize customer booking data to build and evaluate predictive models that can help in acquiring customers before they embark on their holiday.

## Project Overview

Customers today have access to a vast amount of information, which has significantly altered the buying cycle. Airlines must be proactive in attracting customers before they even consider purchasing flights or holidays. Reactive approaches are no longer sufficient.

The key to being proactive lies in the use of data and predictive models. The success of a predictive model hinges on the quality of data used to train machine learning algorithms. This project involved manipulating and preparing customer booking data to build a high-quality predictive model.

## Objectives

- **Data Preparation**: Manipulate and prepare the provided customer booking data.
- **Predictive Model Building**: Create a predictive model to forecast customer behaviour.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance and understand the contribution of each variable to the model's predictive power.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/ba-customer-behaviour-analysis.git
    cd ba-customer-behaviour-analysis
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Run the analysis:**

    Open the `customer_behaviour_analysis.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to perform the data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
